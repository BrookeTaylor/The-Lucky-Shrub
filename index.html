        <h2>Guide to Thriving Plants in Tucson</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>To care for a desert marigold in Tucson, Arizona, start by planting it in a location that receives full sun, as it thrives in the bright, direct sunlight typical of the Sonoran Desert. Water the plant sparingly, as it is drought-tolerant and generally only needs extra water during prolonged dry spells or if grown in a container. Ensure it’s planted in well-draining soil, preferably sandy or rocky, and avoid heavy clay. Fertilizing is minimal; in fact, too much fertilizer can inhibit blooming, so it’s best to refrain from adding any unless absolutely necessary.</p>
          <br>  
        <p>Why Grow Native Plants? Choosing native plants for your garden, like the Desert Marigold, helps support the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for local wildlife, such as pollinators and birds. Native plants are better adapted to the local climate and soil, making them more resilient to drought, pests, and diseases. This means they require less water, fertilizer, and maintenance, helping you save time and resources while contributing to the health of the environment. Plus, with their unique beauty and ability to thrive naturally, native plants create a sense of place and connection to the local landscape.</p>
